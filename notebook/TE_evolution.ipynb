    "We used the program TRsearch from REPET [45] to find the positions of both 5′ and 3′ LTRs from a complete element. \n",
    "We discarded predicted LTRs that did not correspond to the extremity of an element (in a range of 50 bp). Pairs of LTRs were aligned using MUSCLE [75] and insertion dates of LTR-RTs were estimated considering a mutation rate of 1.3 × 10-8 substitutions/site/year [76]. Finally, using R, the distribution of insertion dates was plotted for each family with 20 or more copies with an estimated date. For each distribution, a burst peak date was determined and a period of activity was calculated by considering the shortest period of time containing more than 80% of the dated insertions. Phylogeny was established by computing multiple alignments of all intact LTR-RTs belonging to families RLG_famc1 and RLC_famc2 using MAFFT [70]. A neighbor-joining tree was then built using FasTree [77]. The tree was drawn using figtree 1.4.2 [78].\n",
